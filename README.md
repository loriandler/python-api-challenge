# python-api-challenge
Module 6 Challenge for UM Bootcamp

## Background
Using Python requests, APS and JSON traversals to answer "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Overview
I used python, pandas, statistical analysis, and mapping within Visual Studio Code to create the data requested for this challenge.  Within the two files (WeatherPy and VacationPy), you will find:
 - Cities list using the citipy Library
 - Plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude:
    - Latitude vs Temperature
    - Latitude vs. Humidity 
    - Latitude vs. Cloudiness
    - Latitude vs. Wind Speed
- Linear Regressions for each of the relationships (Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness & Wind Speed)

## Credits
I used: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20126428/how-to-set-the-border-color-of-the-dots-in-matplotlibs-scatterplots to assist with changing the color in some of the scatterplots.

 - Thank you to tutor, Marc Calache, for helping with some of the issues I had with the maps displaying correctly in the VacationPy file when I ran into issues.

  - Thank you to Hunter Hollis, instructor, and TA's: Randy & Sam for all of their teaching and support during this week's lessons of the Bootcamp.
